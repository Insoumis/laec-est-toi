## BRAIN IS DEFEAT

A friendly bee will guide you if you wait once at the beginning of a level.


### BUG IS MORE

> The codebase should be purged with fiendfyre ; spaghetti, crutches, shortcuts, bouerk…

This project is the product of a quick jam from amateurs.  **There will be bugs.**

Some will be hairy.  Some will be icky.  We will try to shield players as best we can.
But, as a level designer, you will see them all.  Brace yourselves!

Report them, fix them, bypass them…   Be creative, and most importantly: _DON'T PANIC_.


## GOD IS YOU

_You make the game._

1. Download [Godot 3](https://godotengine.org/download/),
2. Download [the source](https://framagit.org/laec-is-you/laec-is-you/-/archive/master/laec-is-you-master.zip) and unzip it somewhere.  Even better, `git clone https://framagit.org/laec-is-you/laec-is-you.git` to be able to publish your changes !
3. Run Godot.
4. Open this project.
5. Click on `YOU MAKE LAEC` at the top
6. Enjoy!

> Remember to request a merge of your additions, so that everyone can enjoy them!


### YOU MAKE LEVEL

#### Ingame Editor

Click on `YOU` in the start menu.  Then click `NEW`.


#### Advanced

1. Run Godot, open this project.
2. Click on `YOU MAKE LAEC` in the top dock.
3. Click on `MAKE NEW LEVEL`.  Save your level somewhere in `levels/`.
4. Watch a video: todo

---

You can also make a new map, or submaps.  A map is a level like any other, it just holds portals.


### YOU MAKE ART

Things are in the directory `sprites/items`.



#### PIT IS FALL

- `NOT THING IS NOT THING`
  → should blow up pretty quick, since it will create many items on each turn


## GAME IS OPEN

This game is governed by an enlightened heterarchy, but not in anomy.  _There are rules._

### 1. Radical Inclusion
This game must be safe to play and contribute to by anyone, of any age.

### 2. Gifting
What you do here, unless specified otherwise, will be licensed `CC0`.
The value of a gift is unconditional.
Gifting does not contemplate a return or an exchange for something of equal value.

### 3. Decommodification
We're not here to make money.   That means no advertisements, sponsorships, etc.
We stand ready to protect our culture from such exploitation.
We resist the substitution of consumption for participatory experience.

### 4. Radical Self-reliance
We encourage the individual to discover, exercise and rely on their inner resources.
You have everything you need right in front of you.    _Just do it !    Do it now !_

### 5. Radical Self-expression
No one other than the individual or a collaborating group can determine its content.
You are encouraged to express your unique gifts, in the respect of the rights and liberties of your recipients.

### 6. Communal Effort
We're all in this together, hurtling through space at speeds beyond madness.

### 7. Civic Responsibility
We believe in civil society, heterarchic structures, and harmony between beings and with nature.
Yet here we are, individualists and collectivists of the 99%, on the raggedy edge of our sovereignty…    Don't push me, and I won't push you.

### 8. Leaving No Trace
This game shifts like dunes in the desert.   What we do here may not be there in the morrow.
If you see Bits Out Of Place, please bring them to their optimal location, or flag them as `BOOP`.

### 9. Participation
Our community is committed to a radically participatory ethic.
We believe that transformative change, whether in the individual or in society, can occur only through the medium of deeply personal participation.
We achieve being through doing.   Everyone is invited to work.   Everyone is invited to play.

### 10. Immediacy
Don't be afraid to break the game.  It's OK.  It's actually quite hilarious.
Expect some unexpected.   Best start right now !


## CODE IS CLOSE

_Just kidding._  The code is **WTFPL**.
That means you may do _Whatever The Fork you want_ with it, _except complain_.
The codebase is very immature and prototypal in many aspects, not really up to the standards of open-source.
It is still considered very fluid, and we'd love to hear how you think it should evolve.
We'd love to make adding new concepts easier, but that means extensive changes,
so this refactorization is a good collective jam candidate. (someday?)

The license of the sprite assets is CC0.
Godot Game Engine is MIT.
