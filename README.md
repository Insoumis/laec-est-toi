## BRAIN IS DEFEAT

A friendly bee will guide you if you wait once at the beginning of a level.


### BUG IS MORE

> The codebase should be purged with fiendfyre ; spaghetti, crutches, shortcuts, bouerk…

This project is the product of a quick jam from amateurs.  **There will be bugs.**

Some will be hairy.  Some will be icky.  We will try to shield players as best we can.
But, as a level designer, you will see them all.  Brace yourselves!

Report them, fix them, bypass them…   Be creative, and most importantly: _DON'T PANIC_.


### YOU MAKE LEVEL

#### Ingame Editor

Click on `YOU` in the start menu.  Then click `NEW`.


#### Advanced

Click on `YOU MAKE LAEC` in the top dock.
Click on `MAKE NEW LEVEL`.  Save your level somewhere in `levels/`.

##### Old way

Go to `Scene > New inherited scene`, choose `core/Level.tscn`.

In the Inspector, on the right, select a map scene, and set a title and subtitle.

Select the `Items` layer node, right-click on it, and instance a child scene from `core/Item.tscn`.

You can duplicate the Item child scenes, change their concepts,
move them around, and hit REFRESH in the top dock of the 2D Editor.


Save your scene somewhere in `levels/`.


---

You can also make a new map, or submaps.


### YOU MAKE ART

Things are in the directory `sprites/items`.



#### PIT IS FALL

- `NOT THING IS NOT THING`
  → should blow up pretty quick, since it will create many items on each turn


## GOD IS YOU

_You make the game._

1. Download [Godot 3](https://godotengine.org/download/),
2. Download [the source](https://framagit.org/laec-is-you/laec-is-you/-/archive/master/laec-is-you-master.zip) and unzip it somewhere.  Even better, `git clone https://framagit.org/laec-is-you/laec-is-you.git` to be able to publish your changes !
3. Run Godot.
4. Open this project.
5. Follow instructions.
6. Enjoy!

> Remember to request a merge of your additions, so that everyone can enjoy them!


## CONFIG IS OPEN

Godot allows overriding any part of our `project.godot` file, including (but not limited to) the actions shortcuts.

Create an `override.cfg` file with the parts of the `project.godot` you wish to verride, and put it right next to the distributed binary.

Refer to the [Godot documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/fr/stable/classes/class_projectsettings.html) about this feature.


## CODE IS CLOSE

_Just kidding._  The code is **WTFPL**.
That means you may do _whatever the fork you want_ with it, _except complain_.
The license of the sprite assets is CC0.
Godot Game Engine is MIT.


## SOUND IS STOP TROLL
